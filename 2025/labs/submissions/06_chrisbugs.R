# Conclusion: The adjusted model is slightly different to the non-adjusted model

# The true NBA 3-point make percentage of an average NBA player is not the 
# same as the percentage of all 3-point attempts made in the NBA in a given 
# year. Good 3 point shooters will take more 3 point shots, influencing the 
# overall percentage. To adjust for this, we can incorporate player 
# 3-pt quality into our model as a potential confounder
