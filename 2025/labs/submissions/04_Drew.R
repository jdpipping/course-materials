summary(logistic_mod)
##Question 1: The logistic regression model is a better fit than the linear regression model, as indicated by the lower MSE (Mean Squared Error) of the logistic model compared to the linear model.
 ## Question 2: if ydl = 0 and kq = 0, the model’s predicted probability of “success” is about 98.3 %. 
#That means each additional yard (increasing ydl by 1) multiplies the odds of success by about 0.90 (a 10 % reduction in the odds), holding kq fixed
#So every one-unit bump in kq multiplies the odds of success by about 1.318—i.e., a 31.8 % increase in odds—after controlling for yard line.
