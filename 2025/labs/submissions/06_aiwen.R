### SELECTION BIAS ###
#######################

# The percentage of all 3-point attempts made in the NBA this year favors people who takes 3-point shots more often (they have heavier weight due to selection bias).
# The ”true” 3-point make percentage of an average NBA player takes the simple average of each player's 3-point average.
# So, no player is weighted more heavily than others in the "true" 3-point make percentage.
# therefore, we would expect the first one (percentage of all 3-point attempts made in the NBA) to be higher than the second.
